    <h4>2023.03.03 Geographic Data Brainstorm</h4>
    
    <div class="doc-section">
      
      <p>
        In the past two weeks we have discussed papers about how tool interactions help analysts to make sense of data. Ben Shneiderman outlined a visualization mantra, "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand." This week's papers discussed the users' need for context, describing alternative strategies for navigating complex data spaces. In this activity you will work together to brainstorm visualizations for a dataset that has both geographic and network components. You can choose the specific use case your group wants to pursue, but your design idea must provide the following functionality:
        <ul>
          <li>Effectively visualize some aspect of the dataset for users (you are not required to show both the network and geographic data)</li>
          <li>Begin with an <strong>overview</strong> of the data.</li>
          <li>Provide affordances for <strong>filtering</strong> or <strong>zooming</strong> through data.</li>
          <li>Allow users to request and see some kind of <strong>details</strong> for data that interest them.</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom:0;">
        <strong>Instructions</strong>
      </p>
        <strong>Step 1 - 5 minutes - [GROUP] Identify Key Goals</strong>
        <ol class="narrow-list">
          <li>As a group, read the instructions.</li>
          <li>Together, take a look at the <strong>Domain section</strong> and identify <strong>between 3 and 5 domain tasks</strong> that you want to help users perform through your visualization.</li>
          <li>Rank those tasks in order of importance using any method you'd like</li>
          <!---<li>In any remaining time, inspect some of the <strong>examples</strong> provided at the bottom.</li>--->
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <strong>Step 2 - 10 minutes - [INDIV] Two sketches</strong>
        <ol class="narrow-list">
          <li>Now, working individually, begin making <strong>two very rough visualization sketches</strong> that best satisfy those tasks. Keep them low fidelity.</li>
          <li>Refer back to the <strong>dataset</strong> and think about what you want to show.</li>
          <li>Keep polishing your ideas until your group reconvenes.</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <strong>Step 3 - 20 minutes - [GROUP] Final design</strong>
        <ol class="narrow-list">
          <li>As a group, go around and discuss each person's sketches. Keep it to 1 minute per sketch.</li>
          <li>Working together, create a <strong>consensus sketch</strong>. You will need to pick a group member to record your final idea and present it to the class, but everyone should sketch as they go.</li>
          <li>We will reconvene at the end to check out everyone's ideas.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note that you may design for mobile multi-touch devices or traditional desktop platforms. Pick one.</p>

      <h5 style="padding-top:0;">Your dataset</h5>
      <p>
        Today you will be working with global aircraft flight data. As in previous exercises, you will only have a general data schema. Feel free to invent specific data attributes or other plausible data you might need.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr><td><strong>Each row of data is an individual flight containing:</strong></td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td> Flight number </td><td> AA329, GTI585, etc.  </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Scheduled take-off timestamp </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Actual take-off timestamp </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Scheduled landing timestamp </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Actual landing timestamp </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Was on time </td><td> boolean  </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Total delayed time </td><td> minutes  </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Total time in the air </td><td> minutes  </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Taxi time at both airports </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Number of miles traveled </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Whether cargo or passengers were carried </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Amount of cargo / passengers </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Altitude data </td><td> Alt over flight time, highest point, etc  </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Departing airport code </td><td> KITH, EGLL, RKSI  </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Arriving airport code </td><td>   </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Departing and arriving airport metadata </td><td> Lat/lng, state/country, avg ontime, weather at the time, etc. </td></tr>
      </table>
      <table>
        <tr><td><strong>You can also construct aggregate data for the flights so that users don't have to count things up or average. For example:</strong></td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td> Number of flights between two airports, states, or countries.  </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Average number of flights per hour taking off between two airports </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Min, max, and median lateness for an airport, state, or country </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Histogram of take-off times to show popular days for flights </td></tr>
      </table>
      <table>
        <tr><td><strong>Finally, you can construct network data from this dataset. For example:</strong></td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td> Each airport is a node and each edge is a single flight. </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Each state is a node and there is an edge if a flight happens between the two states. Edges are weighted based on number of flights. </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Each country is a node and weighted edges show the total amount of cargo per week between them. </td></tr>
